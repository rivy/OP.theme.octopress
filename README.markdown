## Octopress Theme

This theme is used for the Octopress.org website (as of 2012-05-01). The `_fonts`
directory holds font resources including original fonts, as well as font subsets
created via [FontSquirrel](FontSquirrel.com). An appropriate font set for the 
user may be chosen and copied to the `source\fonts` directory. If a specific subset
is needed, use `Bebas Neue Regular.otf` and create the appropriate subset via
[FontSquirrel](FontSquirrel.com) using their
[@Font-Face Generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator).

The original Octopress theme used a subset of Bebas Neue Regular containing only
the letters OCTPRES. But, currently, the theme is setup to use the full Western
subset to increase flexibility of the theme for the more general user.
